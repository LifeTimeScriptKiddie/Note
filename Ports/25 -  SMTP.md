# How to enumerate SMTP - ChatGPT
SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) enumeration is the process of gathering information about an SMTP server and its users. Here are some steps you can follow to enumerate SMTP users:

1.  Use `telnet` to connect to the SMTP server: You can use the `telnet` command to connect to an SMTP server and issue commands to it manually. This can be a useful way to gather information about the server and its users.
    
2.  Use the `VRFY` command to verify a user: The `VRFY` command allows you to ask the SMTP server if a particular user exists. You can use this command to verify a list of users and determine which ones are valid.
    
3.  Use the `EXPN` command to expand a mailing list: The `EXPN` command allows you to ask the SMTP server to expand a mailing list and return a list of the individual users that are members of the list.
    
4.  Use the `RCPT TO` command to test email delivery: The `RCPT TO` command allows you to specify a recipient for an email message. You can use this command to test email delivery to different users and see if the SMTP server will accept the message.
    

# Enumeration Tools - ChatGPT
By following these steps, you can enumerate the users of an SMTP server and gather information about how the server is configured and what users are available. It's important to note that some SMTP servers may block or rate-limit these types of requests, so you may need to use additional tools or techniques to gather all of the information you need.

There are a few different tools that you can use to enumerate SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) servers and gather information about their users. Some common options include:

1.  `telnet`: This is a built-in command-line tool that allows you to connect to an SMTP server and issue commands manually. You can use `telnet` to issue commands such as `VRFY` (to verify a user) and `EXPN` (to expand a mailing list) to gather information about the server and its users.
    
2.  `nmap`: This is a network security scanning tool that can be used to perform a variety of network reconnaissance tasks, including SMTP enumeration. You can use `nmap` to scan an SMTP server and gather information about its users and configuration.
    `nmap --script smtp-enum-users.nse -p 25 10.10.10.77 -Pn`
3.  `smtp-user-enum`: This is a command-line tool specifically designed for enumerating SMTP users. It can be used to verify a list of users and expand mailing lists to gather information about the users of an SMTP server.
`└─$ smtp-user-enum -M RCPT -U ./users.txt -t 10.10.10.77`

4.  `Metasploit`: This is a comprehensive penetration testing framework that includes a number of tools for enumerating and testing SMTP servers. You can use the `smtp_enum` module in Metasploit to gather information about the users of an SMTP server.
    

These are just a few examples of the tools that you can use to enumerate SMTP servers and gather information about their users. There are many other options available as well.
