```
Remote Procedure Call is a software communication protocol that one program can use to request a service from a program located in another computer on a network without having to understand the network's details. RPC is used to call other processes on the remote systems like a local system. A procedure call is also sometimes known as a _function call_ or a _subroutine call_.

MSRPC is Microsoft’s implementation of the Distributed Computing Environment/Remote Procedure Calls ([DCE\RPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DCE/RPC)) call system, used for creating and facilitating communication between distributed client and server programs. Users can interact with MSRPC remotely (the scenario implied in the rest of this post) or locally by leveraging Advanced Local Procedure Call (ALPC). ALPC and the majority of other MSRPC components are out of scope for this article. If you’d like to know more about RPC components,
