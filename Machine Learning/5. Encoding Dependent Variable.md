ChatGPT says: 
fit vs fit_transform vs transform

`fit` is used to estimate the parameters (e.g., mean, standard deviation) of a model that will be used to transform data.

`fit_transform` is a combination of `fit` and `transform`. It fits the model to the data and then applies the transformation to the data. This can be more convenient and efficient than calling `fit` and `transform` separately.

`transform` applies a previously fit transformation to a new set of data. It is important to note that the `transform` method can only be applied to data that is consistent with the original training data used to fit the transformation. This means that the number and type of features must be the same as the training data.


```
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# create a StandardScaler object
scaler = StandardScaler()

# fit the scaler to a list of values
scaler.fit([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# transform the values
print(scaler.transform([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))
# [0. -1. -1.1 -1.2 -1.3]

# fit and transform the values in a single step
print(scaler.fit_transform([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))
# [0. -1. -1.1 -1.2 -1.3]

# transform new values
print(scaler.transform([6, 7, 8]))
# [-1.4 -1.5 -1.6]
