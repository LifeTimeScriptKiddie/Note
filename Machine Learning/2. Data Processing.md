## Dependent variable vs feature

Dependent Variable : Being predicted, Usually on the most right column.
Feature : Input variable, usually on the most left column. 
In machine learning, a dependent variable is a variable that is being predicted or modeled, while a feature is an input variable used to make predictions.
A dependent variable is also known as the target or label, and it is the output that you are trying to predict. The dependent variable is what you are trying to predict or explain based on the other variables in your model.

Features, on the other hand, are the input variables that are used to make predictions. These are the variables that are used as inputs to the model and are used to try to predict the dependent variable.

A feature vector is a representation of a set of features in a machine learning model. It is a collection of numerical values that represent the features of an object or sample. In other words, it is a vector of values that represents the features of a sample.
