# Understand Docker

Resource: https://docker-curriculum.com/


What is Docker: Docker is a tool that allows developers, sys-admins etc. to easily deploy their applications in a sandbox (called _containers_) to run on the host operating system i.e. Linux. The key benefit of Docker is that it allows users to **package an application with all of its dependencies into a standardized unit** for software development. Unlike virtual machines, containers do not have high overhead and hence enable more efficient usage of the underlying system and resources.

VM vs Docker
VM: Full process Isolation --> Expensive (Computational Overhead)

Docker Containers : Offers a logical packaing mechanism in which applications can be abstracted from the environment in which they actually run. 
This decoupling allows container-based applications to be deployed easily and consistently, regardless of whether the target environment is a private data center, the public cloud, or even a developerâ€™s personal laptop. This gives developers the ability to create predictable environments that are isolated from the rest of the applications and can be run anywhere.

# Terminology

### Terminology

In the last section, we used a lot of Docker-specific jargon which might be confusing to some. So before we go further, let me clarify some terminology that is used frequently in the Docker ecosystem.

-   _Images_ - The blueprints of our application which form the basis of containers. In the demo above, we used the `docker pull` command to download the **busybox** image.
-   _Containers_ - Created from Docker images and run the actual application. We create a container using `docker run` which we did using the busybox image that we downloaded. A list of running containers can be seen using the `docker ps` command.
-   _Docker Daemon_ - The background service running on the host that manages building, running and distributing Docker containers. The daemon is the process that runs in the operating system which clients talk to.
-   _Docker Client_ - The command line tool that allows the user to interact with the daemon. More generally, there can be other forms of clients too - such as [Kitematic](https://kitematic.com/) which provide a GUI to the users.
-   _Docker Hub_ - A [registry](https://hub.docker.com/explore/) of Docker images. You can think of the registry as a directory of all available Docker images. If required, one can host their own Docker registries and can use them for pulling images.
